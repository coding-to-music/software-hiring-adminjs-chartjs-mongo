## Less secure apps & your Google Account

To help keep your account secure, from May 30, 2022, ‚Äã‚ÄãGoogle no longer supports the use of third-party apps or devices which ask you to sign in to your Google Account using only your username and password.

## Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server

https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229

- smtp.gmail.com (use this)
- Requires SSL: Yes
- Requires TLS: Yes (if available)
- Requires Authentication: Yes
- Port for SSL: 465
- Port for TLS/STARTTLS: 587 (use this)

## Why you may need an App Password

Tip: Don‚Äôt create an App Password unless the app or device you want to connect to your account doesn‚Äôt have ‚ÄúSign in with Google.‚Äù

When you use 2-Step Verification, some less secure apps or devices may be blocked from accessing your Google Account. App Passwords are a way to let the blocked app or device access your Google Account.

## Create & use App Passwords

https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833

If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an App Password.

- Go to your Google Account. https://myaccount.google.com/
- Select Security.
- Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may need to sign in. If you don‚Äôt have this option, it might be because:
- 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
- 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
- Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
- You turned on Advanced Protection.
- At the bottom, choose Select app and choose the app you using and then Select device and choose the device you‚Äôre using and then Generate.
- Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
- Tap Done.

Tip: Most of the time, you‚Äôll only have to enter an App Password once per app or device, so don‚Äôt worry about memorizing it.
