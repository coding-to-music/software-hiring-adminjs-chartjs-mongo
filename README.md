Create & use App Passwords
If you use 2-Step-Verification and get a "password incorrect" error when you sign in, you can try to use an App Password.

- Go to your Google Account. https://myaccount.google.com/
- Select Security.
- Under "Signing in to Google," select App Passwords. You may need to sign in. If you donâ€™t have this option, it might be because:
- 2-Step Verification is not set up for your account.
- 2-Step Verification is only set up for security keys.
- Your account is through work, school, or other organization.
- You turned on Advanced Protection.
- At the bottom, choose Select app and choose the app you using and then Select device and choose the device youâ€™re using and then Generate.
- Follow the instructions to enter the App Password. The App Password is the 16-character code in the yellow bar on your device.
- Tap Done.

Tip: Most of the time, youâ€™ll only have to enter an App Password once per app or device, so donâ€™t worry about memorizing it.
